                        <p>He makes an interesting comparison: two books he couldn't put down - "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand and "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality" by Yudkowsky.</p>

                        <p><strong>Main challenge:</strong> "I don't think AI can FOOM. I don't think intelligence can 'go critical'. This is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence."</p>

                        <p>Timing matters because it determines when we should "shut down" development. The world economy doubles every ~15-30 years. When does it become dangerous?</p>

                        <p><strong>Eliezer:</strong> The problem isn't the rate of economic growth, but when power ends up in hands that can create "super-weapons" against which we have no defense.</p>
                        <p>"If nuclear ballistic missiles end up in the hands of every individual and we have no defense - then we grew too fast."</p>
